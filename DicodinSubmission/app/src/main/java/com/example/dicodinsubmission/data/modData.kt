                    "> Hello brothers. This is going to be the place where we will be developing the Unification Mod for the Dawn of War SoulStorm game, along with the Race Mods. Unification at its core, is an advanced combiner mod that allows you to seamlessly combine almost all community-created races. Make no mistake, this is the ABSOLUTE way to combine races. SCaR, AI, audio, winconditions, rules and all other aspects of the game need CAREFUL treatment, and I have already done the job.\n" +
                    "> With the new version, it got even further. From 5.9 and beyond, it is also an ART REVAMP mod. All nine vanilla races are re-modelled to match higher visual standards.\n" +
                    "> So this place will also be a \"hub\" for most race mods as well. You see, my team leads most of the race mods, so whenever we update one, a Unification note will also be posted.\n" +

(Note that to play on-line, you will need the Steam version.)\n" +
                    "- A capable machine. 3 Ghz CPU / 4 GB Sys mem / 2 GB Vid mem would allow you to play the game at almost full settings. The most important part is the memory. I would say, 6 Gbs + is a must.\n" +

Special thanks for all the video game news outlets for picking it up too, one of my naive unobtainable goals is to actually let whats left of EALA/C&C Remaster team know that there's a lot of people who're still interested and invested into C&C games, especially Generals, which really deserves proper remaster.

                    "    It's \"open-world\", but in a similar way to Dark Souls rather than a sandbox. Resident Evil games are usually very linear due to door locks, so in During the Storm there will be fewer of them to create a bigger sense of scale. Apart from that, the street areas of RE2 and RE3 can be freely explored, along with some new areas, and there will be several sidequests to be completed. These are optional, but unlike in most games, they will have an impact in the main plot -and its 30 NPCs- as well.\n" +
                    "    Branching narrative. Although your choices will change the story and will determine who survives and who dies, this is a Resident Evil game after all, so not everything will be totally different (at least in the short term).\n" +
                    "    Enemies. Mortal Night is known for its high amount of enemies. Meanwhile, in During the Storm there will be relatively few enemies, but these will be much tougher and dangerous. Enemies can also follow you through rooms, which could be seen in the reveal video, where Kevin could also use a RPD key to lock a door and prevent zombies from entering that room. It doesn't apply to all enemies or to all areas, but this mechanic will be commonly present. Apart from this, there will be some enemies never seen in RE2 that will have their own special mechanics.\n" +
                    "    Inventory management is crucial. There will be lots of items to be picked up in DTS, but your inventory will be limited to 6 slots for the most part of the game. That means, no matter how much ammo and healings you have, you will only be able to carry some of them with you, a decision that will gain importance once you venture into big areas with no item boxes.\n" +
                    "    Weapons. Instead of having upgrades like in the original game, here those custom weapons will be independent and will have their own ammo. For instance, there are 3 different guns that use handgun ammo; while there is universal ammo boxes for those, you will commonly find magazines instead, which are only compatible with one of those 3 guns.\n" +
                    "    Internal timer. It is similar to the one of Dead Rising, but it won't be as restrictive. It will mainly be a way of changing the environment as time goes by, unlocking new areas, spawning enemies, and forbidding you to complete some sidequests if you take too long to carry them out. It should guarantee that each playthrough is different, unless you are fast enough and you can complete everything before the time runs out.\n" +

Basically his \"content mounting system\", as I like to call it, saved the day right when I needed it most. I REALLY want you to check out his personal project, Half-Life 2 : Plus, which aims to modify the usual Half-Life 2 experience with small additions, tweaks, and changes to make it not too different, not too similar. His project also adds unique \"Suitless Mode\" which allows player to complete the entire game without your trusty HEV suit. I'd also want to give a shout out to Team Fortress 2 : Classic , which Agent Agrimar is a part of, he's an extremely talented coder and truly his work deserves a recognition. Also, if you're one of them talented source engine folks, he is seeking for some help from modelling and texturing front ( proper suitless hand models, model fixes and what not ), please contact him either through his mod page, or through his profile directly, thank you!\n" +
